			<h2>Who Can Be a Cub Scout?</h2>
			<p>Cub Scouting is for every family!</p><p>Cub Scouting is fun! No matter what grade you are in, Kindergarten through fifth, it can be a blast! Do you like to learn by doing? This is just the place. You can learn to tie knots, set up a tent, or shoot a bow and arrow (archery). Have you ever cooked a meal on a campfire? Sent a secret code to a buddy? Built a birdhouse? Hiked? Are you excited about STEM? Earn awards for all these adventures in Cub Scouts!</p>

			<h2>Who Leads the Pack?</h2>
			<p>All Cub Scout packs are led by volunteers. Usually, those volunteers are the parents of the Scouts but sometimes volunteers also come from the community or the chartered organization. All volunteers must register with the BSA, which includes consent to a background check and reference check, and completion of Youth Protection training. More information about becoming a leader can be found by clicking on "Adult Leaders" in the menu above.</p>

			<h2>What Do Cub Scouts Do?</h2>
			<p>Have you been to the local police station and talked to the policemen on duty? Or visited the fire station and sat in the driver’s seat of the pumper truck? Or visited the local TV station and sat in the news anchor’s chair? These are some of the places you might go with your den or pack.</p>
			<p>You might also build a pinewood derby car and race it on the track, build a sailboat or trimaran and race it in the raingutter regatta, or build a spaceship and race it to the stars in the pack space derby.</p>

		<div class="blocks" id="whichden">
			<h2>Which Den for My Scout?</h2>
			<p>Cub Scout dens are organized by grade level or age. The Cub Scouts work on advancement requirements throughout the school year. At the end of the school year, Scouts are awarded their rank and are automatically graduated into the next den. All Scouts are graduated into the next den but awarding of their rank is dependent on the Scouts finishing their requirements within the school year. This is very different from the ranks in Scouts BSA, the older program, which ranks Scouts by individual effort, not grade.</p>
